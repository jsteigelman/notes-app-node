# Notes App (Node.js Exploration)

This is a basic note-taking app that I built to explore the fundamentals of Node.js.

## Functionality
* This note-taking app uses basic features from Node.js like the ability to read and write from the file system.
* It also utilizes third-party Node.js libraries, like Yargs and Chalk.
