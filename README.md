# Notes App

This is a basic note-taking app that I created in order to explore the fundamentals of Node.js.

## Functionality
* This note-taking app uses basic features from Node.js like the ability to read and write from the file system.
* It also utilizes third party Node.js libraries, including Yargs and Chalk.
